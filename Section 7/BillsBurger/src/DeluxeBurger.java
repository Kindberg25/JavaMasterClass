/*
For the second class, DeluxeBurger, there are no additional member variables, and the constructor accepts no parameters.
Instead, the constructor creates a deluxe burger with all the fixings and chips and a drink for a base price of $19.10.
The constructor can be configured in any way, as long as chips and drink are added for the total price just mentioned.
In this class, the four(4) methods defined in the Hamburger class for including additional toppings must each be
overridden so that a message is printed stating that no additional items can be added to a deluxe burger.
